Hi my name is Alexander Kofi Stone, I live in Brighton UK working remotely as a front-end web developer.
I specialize in Vue.js creating attractive web applications. 

Having a creative background has inspired me to have a design/ aesthetic first approach.
I'm currently in the process of mastering vue, learning PHP & Laravel (for Backend) & also primarily using Node.js
I am looking to collab on exciting projects that focus on UI/ UX with a desire to create original web apps with a 'thinking outside of the box' mentality.
